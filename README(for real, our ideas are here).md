Enhancements for the next deliverable : 
First, we are going to create a GUI to make the game more enjoyable and easier to use, this way we will also be able to "idiot proof" our code with buttons instead of next.XXX() which can be easilly breakeable.
 Secondly, we can implement something to help the players during the game if they don't know how to play, like for example showing the better play, or giving hints.
 Finally, we are going to ameliorate and optimize the program, so that it can be more efficient and less prone to errors.
